# Enigma Self Evaluation

## Functionality
  - I would give myself a 3 +, I have the Enigma class with command line interfaces.  I also have a cracking method, but it only works by brute force and it may or may not work if it is not given a date.

## Object Oriented Programming
  - I think I fall somewhere between a two and a three.  I really struggled with organization and naming in this project as well as keeping track of where everything was and how it was related.  I do have more than two methods than are longer than 7 lines, but no classes longer than 100  lines.  I am not really sure how to make my long methods much shorter and most of the long ones are built for the crack method.  I do feel that I could improve this portion of my project and that my code is somewhat poorly organized and perhaps redundant.

## Test Driven Development
 - My test coverage is good and my naming is pretty good, but there were a few times that I wrote methods and tested them while writing using 'pry' rather than writing a fully comprehensive test.  I would give myself a 3

## Version Control
  - I think I fall somewhere in-between a 3 and a 4.  I have a lot of commits and probably over 15 pull requests, but I am not sure if my commits ever include multiple pieces of functionality and I'm guessing that some of the messages may be ambiguous.
